# Elegant Automation Frameworks with Python and Pytest

My notes from <https://www.udemy.com/course/elegant-automation-frameworks-with-python-and-pytest/>

## Folder Structure

If you follow along the videos, you'll have to move and shuffle things around as you go if you want to keep everything in one repo. As of my section_2, this is the folder structure I'm working with.

```bash
├── Pipfile
├── Pipfile.lock
├── README.md
├── code
│   ├── section_1
│   │   ├── conftest.py
│   │   ├── pytest.ini
│   │   ├── sportscar
│   │   └── test_widget.py
│   └── section_2
│       └── pytest.ini
├── notes
│   └── 01_intro.md
└── requirements.txt
